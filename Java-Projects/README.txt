This repository is used basically used to show my projects made with Java to understand better the programming language and learn the base of it and how it works. As I learned how to program with the C language before (You can check my C projects on my GitHub profile), I had already some ideas of algorithm and programming logic, learning something new to improve my programming skills was still something that helped me to develop myself and my logical thinking.
