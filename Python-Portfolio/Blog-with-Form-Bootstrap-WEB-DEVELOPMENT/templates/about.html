          My name is Rafael Xavier, I'm 18 years old and here you will find some things about me. I'm from Brazil, but live
          currently in Germany. I can speak 4 languages: portuguese (Native language), spanish, english and german. I can
          programm the basic with some programming languages like JavaScript, C, Java and Python (language that is being
          used to create this website). I have done some exercises on different languages, but my biggest projects are with
          Python, since some data banks, games, bots, web-scrappers and etc.

        </p>

          I'm currently studying python and I'm also going to school this year, so I decided to study as much
          programming as I could, because it is something actually joyful for me and I would love to find a job or
          internship in any company to start getting some experience in the programming area. Learning new things is
          always extremely interesting to me and as a self learner, I can tell that it IS one of my favourite hobbies
        </p>
        <p>
          I am living with my family right now and have some interest to live alone, since I've always been so independet,
          but to make this become true, I first have to study hard, and that's why I am programming this little website
          right now !! I hope you enjoyed this project and if you have any interest on be in contact with me, don't
          hesitate on visiting the "contact" area !!
