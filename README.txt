@Rafael Xavier

Hello! My name is Rafael Xavier de Queiroga. I am 19 years old, originally from Brazil, and I have been living in Berlin for the past two years. I can speak 4 languages: Portuguese (my native language), English (Fluent), Spanish (advanced) and German (B2). I am currently studying at the "Oberst√ºfezentrum Informations-Medizintechnick" and I am in the 11th grade, with plans to pursue my Abitur and attend university afterwards.

I have been passionate about programming and computer-related topics since I was a kid, for about a year and a half now I decided to study more about the theme. I have dedicated my time to learning various programming languages and have gained hands-on experience with them. My journey began with JavaScript, where I completed level 1 and 2 programming-courses at TUMO Berlin, spanning approximately 12 weeks of learning. I also participated in the Piscine program, a rigorous selection process for Berlin42, where I learned programming logic and algorithms using the C language, in addition to Linux and Git.

Currently, I am enhancing my skills by studying Python through the "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" and working on independent projects. Additionally, I am learning Java as part of my school's focus on IT and programming education.

Although I do not have any prior professional experience as a programmer, I have had the opportunity to work on group programming projects during my time in Berlin42. These experiences allowed me to collaborate with others and gain valuable insights into the development process. I also have a foundational understanding of areas such as Databases, Algorithms, Back-end, Front-End, and Web Development (HTML/CSS).

I am deeply engaged in the world of programming and computers and am always eager to learn more, explore new challenges, and grow as a developer. I hope you can take something interesting from my projects!
